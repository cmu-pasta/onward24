Alice and Bob are married and filing taxes jointly for the year 2018. Alice was born on 1/1/1981 and Bob was born on 12/30/1975. In 2018, Alice and Bob’s adjusted gross income was $216,350. Alice and Bob do not itemize their deductions and do not qualify for any deductions other than the standard deduction. What is their taxable income for 2018?

Let's think step by step. In each step, reference the section or paragraph number and justify your reasoning. If you encounter any cross-references to other sections or paragraphs, perform the reasoning in a sub-list and return to the previous step. Do this recursively for any subsequent cross-references. If you encounter any substitutions of values, perform the substitution and reproduce the substituted sentences verbatim before deciding if they actually apply. End your response with two special lines as follows:

Answer: <dollar amount calculated>
Coverage: <comma-separated list of rules referenced, identified by their most specific section/paragraph numbers>
Relevance: <comma-separated list of rules that applied to this case because the conditions were true, again identified by their most specific section/paragraph numbers>
---
Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. According to §63(b), since Alice and Bob do not itemize their deductions, their taxable income is their adjusted gross income minus the standard deduction. 
   - They have an adjusted gross income of $216,350.
   - We need to calculate their standard deduction.

2. §63(c)(1) says the standard deduction is the sum of the basic standard deduction and the additional standard deduction.

3. For the basic standard deduction, §63(c)(2) provides dollar amounts, but §63(c)(7) says for a taxable year beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026, paragraph (2) shall be applied with some substitutions.
   1. §63(c)(7)(A)(i) says to substitute "$18,000" for "$4,400" in §63(c)(2)(B).
      - After substitution, §63(c)(2)(B) reads: "$18,000 in the case of a head of household (as defined in section 2(b))". This does not apply as Alice and Bob are filing jointly, not as head of household.
   2. §63(c)(7)(A)(ii) says to substitute "$12,000" for "$3,000" in §63(c)(2)(C).
      - After substitution, §63(c)(2)(C) reads: "$12,000 in any other case". 
   3. §63(c)(2)(A) says the basic standard deduction is 200% of the amount in §63(c)(2)(C) for a joint return. 
      - Since §63(c)(2)(C) is $12,000 after the substitution, the basic standard deduction for Alice and Bob is $24,000.

4. For the additional standard deduction, §63(c)(3) says it is the sum of the additional amounts the taxpayer is entitled to under §63(f).
   1. §63(f)(1)(A) provides an additional amount of $600 if the taxpayer has attained age 65 before the close of the taxable year. Bob was born on 12/30/1975, so he was 43 in 2018 and this does not apply. Alice was born on 1/1/1981, so she was 37 in 2018 and this also does not apply.
   2. §63(f)(1)(B) provides an additional $600 for the spouse of the taxpayer if the spouse has attained age 65 and an additional exemption is allowable under §151(b). Neither condition is met (Bob is under 65, and they are filing jointly so §151(b) does not provide an additional exemption). So this also does not apply.
   - Therefore, Alice and Bob are not entitled to any additional standard deduction under §63(f).

5. The total standard deduction is thus just the basic standard deduction of $24,000.

6. Going back to §63(b), the taxable income is the adjusted gross income of $216,350 minus the standard deduction of $24,000.

Therefore:

Answer: $192,350
Coverage: §63(b), §63(c)(1), §63(c)(2), §63(c)(7), §63(c)(7)(A)(i), §63(c)(7)(A)(ii), §63(c)(2)(A), §63(c)(2)(C), §63(c)(3), §63(f), §63(f)(1)(A), §63(f)(1)(B), §151(b) 
Relevance: §63(b), §63(c)(1), §63(c)(7), §63(c)(7)(A)(ii), §63(c)(2)(A), §63(c)(2)(C)

Sure, here's a scenario where §63(f)(1)(B) applies but §63(f)(1)(A) does not:

Charlie and Diane are married and filing taxes jointly for the year 2018. Charlie was born on 3/15/1985 and Diane was born on 8/22/1953. In 2018, Charlie and Diane's adjusted gross income was $185,000. Charlie and Diane do not itemize their deductions and do not qualify for any deductions other than the standard deduction.

In this scenario, Diane has attained age 65 before the close of the 2018 tax year, so §63(f)(1)(B) applies, entitling Charlie to an additional standard deduction amount for his spouse. However, Charlie himself has not attained age 65 before the close of the 2018 tax year, so §63(f)(1)(A) does not apply.
---
Great! Now assume that §63(f)(1)(B) had only the following text instead of the original I provided above:

"(B) for the spouse of the taxpayer if the spouse has attained age 65 before the close of the taxable year."

Can you give me an example such that §63(f)(1)(B) would apply with the modified rule but it would not apply with the original rule?
---
Sure, here's a scenario where the modified §63(f)(1)(B) would apply, but the original §63(f)(1)(B) would not:

Ellie and Frank are married, but they are filing their taxes separately for the year 2018. Ellie was born on 5/10/1980 and Frank was born on 2/28/1952. In 2018, Ellie's adjusted gross income was $75,000 and Frank's adjusted gross income was $50,000. Neither Ellie nor Frank itemize their deductions and they do not qualify for any deductions other than the standard deduction.

Under the modified rule, §63(f)(1)(B) would apply to Frank because he has attained age 65 before the close of the 2018 tax year. This means Frank would be entitled to an additional standard deduction amount for being aged 65 or older, even though he and Ellie are filing separately.

However, under the original rule, §63(f)(1)(B) would not apply to Frank because it requires not only that the spouse has attained age 65, but also that "an additional exemption is allowable to the taxpayer for such spouse under section 151(b)." 

Section 151(b) only allows an additional exemption for a spouse if a joint return is not made and the spouse has no gross income. In this scenario, Frank does have gross income, so even though he is over 65, the original §63(f)(1)(B) would not apply to him because Ellie cannot claim an additional exemption for him under §151(b).
