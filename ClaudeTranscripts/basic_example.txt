Alice and Bob are married and filing taxes jointly for the year 2018, taking the standard deduction. Alice was born on 1/1/1981 and Bob was born on 12/30/1975. In 2018, Alice and Bob’s adjusted gross income was $216,350. Alice and Bob do not itemize their deductions and do not qualify for any deductions other than the standard deduction. What is their taxable income for 2018?

Let's think step by step. In each step, reference the section or paragraph number and justify your reasoning. If you encounter any cross-references to other sections or paragraphs, perform the reasoning in a sub-list and return to the previous step. Do this recursively for any subsequent cross-references. If you encounter any substitutions of values, perform the substitution and reproduce the substituted sentences verbatim before deciding if they actually apply. End your response with the final dollar amount on its own line.

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. According to §63(b), for individuals who do not itemize deductions, taxable income is defined as adjusted gross income minus the standard deduction. 
   - Alice and Bob's adjusted gross income is $216,350.
   - We now need to calculate their standard deduction.

2. According to §63(c)(1), the standard deduction is the sum of:
   (A) the basic standard deduction, and
   (B) the additional standard deduction.
   
   Let's calculate each of these:

   2.1. For the basic standard deduction, §63(c)(2) provides the amounts, but §63(c)(7) has special rules for 2018-2025. It states in §63(c)(7)(A) that for these years, paragraph (2) shall be applied:
      (i) by substituting "$18,000" for "$4,400" in subparagraph (B), and
      (ii) by substituting "$12,000" for "$3,000" in subparagraph (C).

      Applying these substitutions to §63(c)(2), it reads:
      
      (2) Basic standard deduction
      
      For purposes of paragraph (1), the basic standard deduction is-
      
      (A) 200 percent of the dollar amount in effect under subparagraph (C) for the taxable year in the case of-
         (i) a joint return, or
         (ii) a surviving spouse (as defined in section 2(a)),
         
      (B) $18,000 in the case of a head of household (as defined in section 2(b)), or
      
      (C) $12,000 in any other case.

      Since Alice and Bob are filing a joint return, subparagraph (A) applies, which is 200% of the amount in subparagraph (C). Subparagraph (C) states $12,000, so their basic standard deduction is $24,000.

   2.2. For the additional standard deduction, §63(c)(3) states it is the sum of each additional amount the taxpayer is entitled to under subsection (f).
   
      §63(f)(1) provides additional amounts for the aged. It states the taxpayer is entitled to an additional $600:
      (A) for himself if he has attained age 65 before the close of his taxable year, and
      (B) for the spouse of the taxpayer if the spouse has attained age 65 before the close of the taxable year
      
      In 2018, Alice was 37 and Bob was 42, so neither of them is entitled to the additional amount. Therefore, their additional standard deduction is $0.

3. Summing the results from 2.1 and 2.2, Alice and Bob's total standard deduction is $24,000.

4. Going back to §63(b), their taxable income is their adjusted gross income of $216,350 minus their standard deduction of $24,000.

$216,350 - $24,000 = $192,350

Therefore, Alice and Bob's taxable income for 2018 is $192,350.
