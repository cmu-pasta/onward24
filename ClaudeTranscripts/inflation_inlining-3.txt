Alice and Bob are married and filing taxes jointly for the year 2025. Alice was born on 1/1/1981 and Bob was born on 12/30/1975. Alice and Bob do not itemize their deductions and do not qualify for any deductions other than the standard deduction. What is the standard deduction available to them?

The average C-CPI-U values for relevant calendar years are as follows:

 2017  2018  2019  2020  2021  2022  2023  2024
138.2 141.0 143.2 144.8 149.1 159.9 168.3 172.5

Let's think step by step as to which rules apply, and stop if you come across an applicable rule R that requires substitution of some value or phrase X in place of Y in rule S. In this case, do not attempt to apply any other rules or compute the final answer. Instead, I only want to perform a single substitution. Please only return a modified version of the relevant statute S with the substitution performed. End your response with the following:

Modified rule: S
Modified by: R
Updated text for rule S: <new text replacing Y with X>
---
The relevant rules are:

§63(c)(7)(B)(ii) provides that for tax years beginning after 2018, the standard deduction amounts of $18,000 and $12,000 shall be increased by a cost-of-living adjustment. The adjustment shall be determined under §1(f)(3) by substituting "2017" for "2016" in §1(f)(3)(A)(ii).

§1(f)(3)(C) states that for any provision that provides for the substitution of a year after 2016 for "2016" in §1(f)(3)(A)(ii), §1(f)(3)(A) shall be applied by substituting "the C-CPI-U for calendar year 2016" for "the CPI for calendar year 2016" and all that follows in §1(f)(3)(A)(ii).

Therefore, the following substitution should be made:

Modified rule: §1(f)(3)(A)
Modified by: §1(f)(3)(C) 
Updated text for §1(f)(3)(A):

(A) In general

    The cost-of-living adjustment for any calendar year is the percentage (if any) by which—

    (i) the C-CPI-U for the preceding calendar year, exceeds

    (ii) the C-CPI-U for calendar year 2016.
