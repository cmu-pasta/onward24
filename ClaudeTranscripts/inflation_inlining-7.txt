Alice and Bob are married and filing taxes jointly for the year 2025. Alice was born on 1/1/1981 and Bob was born on 12/30/1975. Alice and Bob do not itemize their deductions and do not qualify for any deductions other than the standard deduction. What is the standard deduction available to them?

The average C-CPI-U values for relevant calendar years are as follows:

 2017  2018  2019  2020  2021  2022  2023  2024
138.2 141.0 143.2 144.8 149.1 159.9 168.3 172.5

Let's think step by step as to which rules apply, and stop if you come across an applicable rule R that requires substitution of some value or phrase X in place of Y in rule S. In this case, do not attempt to apply any other rules or compute the final answer. Instead, I only want to perform a single substitution. Please only return a modified version of the relevant statute S with the substitution performed. End your response with the following:

Modified rule: S
Modified by: R
Updated text for rule S: <new text replacing Y with X>

If no more substitutions are required to calculate the final answer, then just perform the calculation and end your response with the answer.

To determine the standard deduction available to Alice and Bob, we need to apply the rules in §63(c).

1. Since Alice and Bob are married and filing jointly, they fall under §63(c)(2)(A), which states that the basic standard deduction is 200% of the amount in §63(c)(2)(C).

2. §63(c)(2)(C) sets the base amount at $12,000, increased by $12,000 multiplied by 24.82%, rounded down to the nearest $50. This calculation results in a base amount of $14,950 for the year 2025.

3. Applying the 200% multiplier from §63(c)(2)(A), the basic standard deduction for Alice and Bob is $29,900.

4. Next, we need to determine if Alice and Bob are entitled to any additional standard deduction amounts under §63(c)(3) and §63(f)(1).

5. As of 2025, Alice is 44 years old (born 1/1/1981) and Bob is 49 years old (born 12/30/1975). Neither of them has attained the age of 65 before the close of the taxable year, so they are not entitled to the additional amount under §63(f)(1).

Therefore, the total standard deduction available to Alice and Bob for the year 2025 is $29,900.
